<h2> About this project: </h2>

This repository is my project for the [Practical Machine Learning Fundamentals Course at Platzi](https://platzi.com/clases/fundamentos-ml/)

As well, this is one of the challenges for Platzi Master -- an education acceleration program to form the future tech leaders in LATAM.

<h2> Brief description : </h2>

In this image classifier, we use tensorflow to predict pieces of clothes from a loaded dataset. In this way, deep learning was used to create and train an artificial neural network. The final outcome is a image classifier that has a 87% accuracy rate.
